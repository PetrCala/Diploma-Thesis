- Some crucial variables that the twin approach is built around (method Selection/FE, FD,...) do not have sufficient observation count to make up a new variable in the merged dataset -> would have to ditch these important variables
- From another perspective, forcing the merge in spite of this fact could lead to variable poisoning across the sets, where each variable would either have to be interpolated, making the portion of 'useful' data drop either further.
- Missing variables cross-data -> it is not like one is a superset of the other; both are quite different in their nature as far as heterogeneity is concerned.
- Then you could say - then just ditch the variables and check only the effect/se, i.e. publication bias. But there is arguably more information about PB when dissecting the data frames separately, than merged together. Questions such as 'is there publication bias in the natural studies' can be answered in the separate approach.
- Mixing apples with oranges - the goal of the natural studies is a bit different, as in see a group of subjects whose prospects are fundamentally different than the main data frame subjects. Mixing these together gets rid of this bonus ability of the data, and brings little information to an already robust data frame.
