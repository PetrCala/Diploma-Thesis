Dear colleagues,

I write to you because I know you have recently written a meta-analysis, or are working on one.

For your potential interest, Zuzana, our colleagues, and I have developed a new meta-analysis estimator, MAIVE (Meta-Analysis Instrumental Variable Estimator), which is robust to publication bias, p-hacking, and mistakes in or manipulation with reported precision.

The paper with an R package is available here:

http://meta-analysis.cz/maive/

A shorter version of the paper (20 minute read) can be found on the MAER-Net blog:

With the R package it's easy to apply the method, so it might be useful as a robustness check for your thesis/paper.

Have a great weekend,

Tomas
