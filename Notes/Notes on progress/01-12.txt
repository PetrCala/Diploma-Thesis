Exploration of the P&P (2018) meta analysis

-Transformed the original dataset into a form that R is able to handle easily

-Tried running several simple regressions (mincerian private returns ~ years of schooling)

-Did a bunch of reading on the Mincer equation

-Started collecting/downloading the studies from P&P - found several that are difficult to find - left for later
