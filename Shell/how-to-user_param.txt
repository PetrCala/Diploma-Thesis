- The user_parameters_model.yaml file should hold a form of the parameters that the user can always reproduce the
	results with. That is because this file gets copied directly to the Dist/ folder upon running the 
	"update_dist.sh" Shell script (see the Shell/ folder).
- The R/user_parameters.yaml file is then meant for liberal modifications, testing, exploration, etc. However, any changes
	that you make to this file, should also be made in the *_model.yaml file, assuming they are structural changes
	in code behavior. Say you add a new functionality and test it using the "R/user_parameters.yaml" file, then this
	must be also added to the "*_model.yaml" file.
- All other files within the custom_user_params/ folder should be listed within the update_user_params.sh Shell script,
	as they will get all thus updated upon the script run. Any discrepancies that exist between the model .yaml file
	and the other .yaml files (in the custom_user_params/ folder) should be incorporated directly into the shell script
	code. As such, if you wish to modify these custom .yaml files, refer to the shell script, and not to the .yaml files
	themselves.
- Remember to periodically run the Shell/ files in order to keep the .yaml files synchronized and valid across folders and
	different iterations of the repository.
