To do:
-Figure out the categorization of the dependent variable - what it is that you want to run the regression on

-Take a look into the lecture notes (lesson on Panel data) - be sure you are using the appropriate methods (possibly FE) and try running this in R

-Take notes along the way



Notes on the dependent variable:

"Rate of return estimates of investment in education - selected by the authors (P&P 2018) based on their ability to extract a rate of return in a study
When the rate of return was not reported, the authors computed the number through coefficients of the Mincerian function (if those were reported)
	-Here the task should be to know what the Mincerian equation looks like, fitted on the data, first of all (their data, that is)

As a reminder, the equation consists of the rate of return to education as a dep variable, and then "years of schooling", "years of lavor market experience", and
	squares of the two dependent variables
