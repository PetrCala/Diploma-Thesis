Revision of the P&P dataset

-Went through all studies of the P&P, checked that the appendix with the studies list that they provide corresponds to their dataset.
	In this dataset, some observations seem to be coming from multiple sources (studies) - these remain to be checked.

-A few observations on Hong Kong returns to education by Yeung (1999) can not be traced back to the original study (as of 10th Jan).

-Created an excel to track all these studies and created a list of unique studies that P&P use in their meta-analysis
	(total 250 studies/papers)

-In the future, plan to run the regressions to see whether we obtain the same result as the original paper

-Studies that failed the "Comparison of dataset validity", i.e. they appeared in the dataset but not in the annex,
	as spotted by the validity test on the 2nd sheet of the aforementioned excel file:
	-Tenjo et al. (2015)
	-Chase (1998)
	-Filer, Jurajda, Planovsky (1999)
	-Flabbi, Paternostro & Tiongson (2007)
	-Lassibille & Tan (2005)
	

-Note that there were no rows found with 2 semicolons, and all the studies from the rows containing semicolons were soundly found
	in the original studies list, which leaves only the 5 abovementioned studies (along with Yeung (1999)) showing a problem
