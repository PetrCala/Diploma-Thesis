- Specify the source/ folder for the data files. This defaults to the R/_results/ folder from the main code part.
	The tables are automatically loaded from there, so there is no need to move them anywhere if you do not wish to do so.
- In "populate_tables_source.py", define the methods according to the TeX table forms you wish to use.
- Run the "main.py" script. This will create .txt files in the _output/ folder for each method you have defined.
- Simply take the contents of the .txt files and copy them into a TeX editor. Have fun.
