- See the 'tables/src' folder. Each of the subfolders there contains the information about headers/footers expected for a given table. If you wish to modify any of the table output .tex code, start here by modifying the source .txt files. Do not move or rename the files.
- Preprocessing steps for each table are defined in the `tables/utils/table_static.py` file. Here, each table is fully characterized by a single dictionary element, and the preprocessing/transformation steps are defined as method names. For available transformation methods, see the `tables/utils/classes.py` modules, where the preprocessing class is defined.
- Run the "main.py" script. This will create .txt files in the _output/ folder for each table in the static TABLES object.
- Simply take the contents of the .txt files and copy them into a TeX editor. Have fun.
