\multicolumn{7}{>{\scriptsize}p{0.95\linewidth}}{\emph{Note:}  The table reports estimates of the effect beyond bias using six non-linear methods and estimates of the publication bias obtained using two of these methods. WAAP = Weighted Average of the Adequately Powered \citep{Ioannidis2017Waap}. Top10 = Top10 method by \cite{Stanley2010Top}. Stem = the stem-based method by \cite{Furukawa2019Stem} where P represents the probability of results insignificant at 5\% being published relative to the probability of the significant ones at the same level. Hier = Hierarchical Bayes model \citep{Allenby2006Hier}. AK = \cite{Andrews2019Selection}'s Selection model. Kink = Endogenous kink model by \cite{Bom2019Kink}. Standard errors, clustered at the study level, are included in parentheses. ***p<0.01, **p<0.05, *p<0.1 }
