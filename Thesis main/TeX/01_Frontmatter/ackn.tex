\section*{Acknowledgments}

I express my sincere and unyielding gratitude to my supervisor, \Supervisor, for her unwavering support, guidance, and overall being the role model for all and any supervisors out there, even far beyond the borders of Charles University. An equal amount of gratitude, if so possible, I then send to prof. Tom\'{a}\v{s} Havr\'{a}nek, for his invaluable insight, expertise, feedback, and guidance throughout the process. Further, I thank prof. Tom Stanley of Deakin University, prof. Chisio Furukawa of Yokohama National University, Franti\v{s}ek Barto\v{s} of University of Amsterdam, and prof. Bob Reed of University of Canterbury, all for providing me with valuable suggestions for the technical parts of the thesis. A special thanks goes out to the group of undergraduate colleagues from my university who volunteered to test out my GitHub code during its development stages.
