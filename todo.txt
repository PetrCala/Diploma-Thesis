- Consider improvements

Data collection:
- Subset the P&P data set into only those estimates dealing with Mincerian equation, and only the private returns
- Collect all the primary studies, add them to the literature master excel
- Look for any potential existing queries in the primary literature
- Read the proposal thoroughly again, get the overall picture
- Think about the direction of the thesis, outline the to-do for the whole work in major steps  (append to this file)
- Construct own query using the python code, try to match it with the P&P dataset, look for new studies
- Construct a preliminary set of variables to collect
- Validate the P&P dataset, add all feasible variables, keep on track with the original goal, proposal, while doing so
- Run the query, get new literature, make it into a list in the main literature excel
- Screen and download the additional literature
- Check the cookbook again at this point, confirm all is done until point 21)
- Prepare to collect the remaining data - note the statistics of studies screened, downloaded
- Try collecting about 5 studies of the P&P, observe the trend in variables
- Construct a new set of variables to collect, continuously update until 15-20 works are collected
- Collect all P&P available data plus additional variables
- Collet new studies plus additional variables

-Go through various P&P studies to see, whether they deal with the ability at all in Mincer regressions
-If yes, continue collecting, possibly
-But better yet, create the query, get a new list of studies, and start collecting from there - should mostly (at least 30%) contain ability
	in Mincer regression
