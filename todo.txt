Data collection:
-Transform the raw query data from SERPAPI to the main literature file, make a list of 574 works from the query, that you will go through,
	and stick to this list
-Get all citations, authors, names etc. into one, single, well-managed sheet
-Append the info about the already collected works
-Go through the rest of the works in an efficient way



- Subset the P&P data set into only those estimates dealing with Mincerian equation, and only the private returns
- Collect all the primary studies, add them to the literature master excel
- Look for any potential existing queries in the primary literature
- Read the proposal thoroughly again, get the overall picture
- Think about the direction of the thesis, outline the to-do for the whole work in major steps  (append to this file)
- Construct own query using the python code, try to match it with the P&P dataset, look for new studies
- Construct a preliminary set of variables to collect
- Validate the P&P dataset, add all feasible variables, keep on track with the original goal, proposal, while doing so
- Run the query, get new literature, make it into a list in the main literature excel
- Screen and download the additional literature
- Check the cookbook again at this point, confirm all is done until point 21)
- Prepare to collect the remaining data - note the statistics of studies screened, downloaded
- Try collecting about 5 studies of the P&P, observe the trend in variables
- Construct a new set of variables to collect, continuously update until 15-20 works are collected
- Collect all P&P available data plus additional variables
- Collet new studies plus additional variables
